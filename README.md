# OpenAlias server

Needless to say - this is **very** early beta of the program, current area of focus:

- Alias registration process.
- Figuring out some PoW function (maybe just mining some p2pool shares?) as a cost of registration.
- Way to store domains in a easy and accessible and auditable way (most likely Git repository).
